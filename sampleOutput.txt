That fact alone puts him in distinguished company: with the Preacher in Pale Rider (1985), for instance, played by Clint Eastwood, who had already enshrined the Man with No Name in three al-dente Westerns. The first of them, A Fistful of Dollars (1964), was the direct offspring of Akira Kurosawas Yojimbo, which, in turn, was a first cousin once removed of Dashiell Hammetts Red Harvest, a novel whose protagonist, with a heart like a corn husk, was known only as the Continental Op. And so this mini-band of brothersunsmiling, unidentified, but all too recognizablecontinues to grow. To qualify, you need only do a clean and thorough job, whatever the smuts of a dirty world. If you have to break heads, do it in a good cause. And, above all, whether youre in charge of a horse or an Impala, ride hard.\nThe first car that is assigned to our guy, in Drive, is indeed a Chevy Impala, in numbing silver-gray. No one will be looking at you, he is told, and thats the point. Though tuned and buffed under the hood, the Chevy remains a heroically dull machine, perhaps the least memorable chase weapon since Roy Scheider clambered into a Pontiac Ventura, the color of a very tired squirrel, in The Seven-Ups (1973). That model was even glummer than the Pontiac LeManswho was kidding whom, with that name?in which Gene Hackman raced against an Elevated train, two years earlier, in The French Connection; and both, of course, were nothing beside the gleaming flanks of the Mustang used in Bullitt (1968). If you want to be seen, like Steve McQueen, you sport your car as if it were a suit, tailor made to your skills. If you want to fade into the background, though, like the fellow in Drive, you get something you can steal and leave behind.\nThe Driverwe have to call him something, I guesslives in L.A., where he moonlights as a getaway man. Not that theres much of a moon. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, prefers the glow of neon, stop signs, and the pools of light that leak through a garage. It takes a while to learn what the Driver does in sunshine, and the discovery feeds the smartest scene in the movie. The day after he and the Impala ferry a pair of thieves away from a warehouse robbery, we find him walking along in police uniform. Great twist, we think: a cop who helps robbers after hours. But then, just as were digesting that news, he gets into a police vehicle, guns it, and crashes it, with a camera crew looking on. Hes not a cop, after all, but a stunt driver, playing a cop, doubling for an actor who cant be risked in a smash. To sum up: in the space of a few minutes, our take on this man has flipped and rolled over, twice, and nothing is quite what it seems. Anyone seeing the title of the movie and hoping for a pedal-stomping update on Convoy or Smokey and the Bandit will, by now, be feeling a mite confused. \nNaturally, the Driver lives alone. Down the hall is the apartment of Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). The Driver meets her and, against regulations, falls in love; at any rate, he cracks a smile, and twitches the toothpick that sits at the side of his mouth, so something must be stirring in his soul. The boys father, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail, and, when he comes out, the Driver, far from showing hostility, befriends him, and offers assistancea courtly, old-fashioned gesture, as though he lacked any better way of expressing his feelings for Irene. If Lancelot had lived next door to Guinevere, he would have done the same. Standard needs dough to pay off prison debts, which means taking part in a heist. The plan is that the Driver will chauffeur him to and from the job, without letting Irene hear about it. Needless to say, the plan backfires, and both men fall prey to some unsavory specimens, led by Bernie (Albert Brooks), with a glittering collection of knives, and Nino (Ron Perlman), who looks like something out of The Descent of Man.\nA surprisingly high fraction of Drive is indebted to The Driver, Walter Hills whittled-down thriller of 1978. The two films share that first pursuit, through a velvet-dark L.A.; the often wordless hero; a troublesome bag of cash; automobiles that dont simply whisk along but hide in corners, like cats; and the spare bursts of music, with Refn opting for an electronic underthrob, at the start, that nags like a migraine. Yet he also veers away from Hill in striking fashion, ditching any notion of a cop as a suitable nemesis (The Driver brought on Bruce Dern at his loopiest), and choosing, for a heroine, not the blank beauty of Isabelle Adjani, who appeared to be molded from porcelain, but the vulnerable sweetness of Carey Mulligan, whose smile would cause many road users to lose their grip and cannon into a lamppost. Last, nothing in Hills film is as entertaining as Bernies riff on his past career. In the nineteen-eighties, it appears, before launching into crime, he produced movies. One critic called them European, he recalls, adding, I thought they were shit. Credit to Refn, who is Danish, for running that gag.\nAll this is excellent news, which makes it doubly wretched to report that, having delighted in the doominess of Drive, as its journey began, I ended much less joyful than repelled. What happened? In short, an explosionnot of a flaming car, or a bombed building, but of a head. (Whose head, I will not reveal, except to say that to damage such a performer, whether with a slap or, as here, with a shotgun, strikes me as a crime against nature.) Refn seems to have a thing about heads, and about the hurt that they can suffercapital punishment, in the worst sense. We watch as the Driver stamps, time and again, on the skull of a villain in an elevator; but what exactly are we watching, as the camera rests, for a second, on the mashed-up result? Prosthetics, pixellation, pastry dough? The people around me reacted with the eewrrgh sound that has become de rigueur in the viewing of violence, followed by the traditional hasty giggle to pop the tension; even those moviegoers who revel in such a sight, however, might usefully pause to inspect the kick of pleasure that it provokes. No doubt they will have seen much worse, and they will also know that a bursting brain is no more real than a game of Quidditch, yet what perturbs me about a film as careful and as intelligent as Drive is its manifest delusion that, in refusing to look away from the minutiae of nastiness, it is actually drawing us closer to the truth about pain.'}, {'url': u'http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/a-high-octane-drive/245180/', 'rating': 2, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Christopher Orr', 'text': 'Christopher Orr - Christopher Orr is a senior editor atThe Atlantic.

Allow me to back up: If you watch a lot of films, you\'ll see good ones and bad ones,     some of them exceptional in one direction or the other. But whatever genre they might inhabitaction flick, historical drama, romantic comedythey tend     to line up along one relatively familiar spectrum or another.     \nThe stylistic elements are familiar, and yet they are assembled into something fresh, vital, and astonishingly intense     Now and then, though, you see a film that jumps off the spectrum altogether, one that reminds you that novel possibilities exist even within the most     well-worn cinematic conventions. In the most extreme casesAnnie Hall, say, or Star Wars or Pulp Fictionsuch a movie possesses     enough gravity to realign the spectrum altogether. And while Drive, the stunning Hollywood debut of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, is     unlikely to have such an impact (it is a triumph of execution more than formula), it is nonetheless a minor revelation.          The narrative and stylistic elements of Refn\'s film are familiarindeed it is awash in echoes and allusionsyet they are assembled into something fresh     and vital and astonishingly intense. Ryan Gosling stars as a movie stunt driver who moonlights as a by-appointment-only wheelman for crooks who lack     their own wheels. (Think of him as the Zipcar of getaway drivers.) His mentor in endeavors both licit and illicit is Shannon (Bryan Cranston), a     hard-luck garage owner who imagines that his fortunes might still take a turn for the better. Gosling\'s character, known only as "the driver," meets     and takes a quiet interest in Irene (Carey Mulligan), a pretty apartment-building neighbor who lives with her son while she waits for her husband     (Oscar Isaac) to finish out a prison sentence. Rounding out the principal cast are Albert Brooks (in a notably unBrooksian role), Mad Men\'s     Cristina Hendricks, and the ambulatory Easter Island head known as Ron Perlman.   \n   \n     The less said of the plot, I think, the better: Though its premises are conventional enough, it swerves down unexpected avenues. Going into the film, I     knew very little of what was to take place, and I wouldn\'t have had it any other way. Suffice it to say that the movie is an homage to old car-cult     B-movies such as Bullitt and The Driver, and that it starts slowly before accelerating to harrowing velocity. The first half has a bit of     the moody, music-video feel of Hong Kong\'s Wong Kar-Wai; the latter half, the shocking, visceral ferocity of Korea\'s Park Chan-Wook. The extreme and     escalating violence will prove off-putting to somefrankly, I\'m surprised not to have been among thembut for the rest, Drive is a needle-punch     of adrenaline to the aorta.          The film\'s elegant cinematography is by Newton Thomas Sigel, Bryan Singer\'s usual collaborator, and the script is adapted by Hossein Amini from the     James Sallis novel. The cast is uniformly strongin particular Gosling, whose lithe, wary presence suits the iconic aspirations of the role. But the     true star of Drive is director Refn (the Pusher trilogy, Bronson, Vahalla Rising), who proves himself to be admirably     dangerous at any speed. Scene after scene is suspended in exquisite tension, by turns romantic and murderousand, in one notable instance, both. It is     a testament to Refn\'s supple gifts that the same film in which Gosling and Mulligan trade sheepish grins amid awkward silences can subsequently rise to     operatic malevolence and yet feel entirely of a piece.   \n       Among its many resonances, Drive reminded me of Neil Jordan\'s Mona Lisa, another tale of a driver teetering between innocence and     cruelty; of Sergio Leone\'s Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West, with their nameless, laconic protagonists and meticulous     buildups to spasms of sudden violence; of the original 1971 Get Carter and its intoxicating pitilessness; of Halloween in its use     ofwell, you\'ll see. It reminded me of late Cronenberg and early Scorsese, of Michael Mann without the preening and Tarantino without the ADHD. Most of     all, though, Drive reminded me of what it can be likewhat it ought to be, but so infrequently is, liketo go out to the movies. I was buzzing     when I left the theater. I\'m buzzing still.\n   \n After you comment, click Post.

But then, "Drive," directed with cool confidence by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, isn\'t easy to peg.\n  Based on James Sallis\' 2005 small-press novel, it\'s a moody ride, steered by a director with an uncanny sense of cinema\'s rhythms. A portrait of a laconic wheelman known as Driver, it\'s a high-performance vehicle for shrewd professionals, from Gosling to vets Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston and Ron Perlman.\n The film begins funky  and we mean in a good way. The opening credits arrive in a hot- pink cursive that evokes a "what tha?" And the soundtrack offers hints of the electronic pulse of \'80s pop.\n When closed-mouthed Driver wheels through nighttime Los Angeles or interacts with garage owner Shannon (Cranston), the movie shows off its noir roots. When he starts to hanker for neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), it stirs in a not-too- cloying syrup of romance. \n Driver is a man of very few words, unless he\'s instructing a client on his five-minute rule: Criminals have his fealty for that window. After that  well. ... \n His side job as a Hollywood stunt driver keeps his skill set whetted. It\'s a gig that also anchors "Drive" squarely in the realm of the Dream Factory.\n Refn, who won the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel maneuver the dreaminess of a late-afternoon date as easily as they accelerate through the nightmare of a daytime assault. Not since "Collateral," Michael Mann\'s nocturnal tour of L.A., has that city been so well cruised. \n Driver is a hero in the underground world of the antihero. Sure, the tentative dance between him and Irene is guy- meets-gal, mechanic-courts- waitress. \n Ryan Gosling, right, gives his character Driver a "just visiting this planet" demeanor. It\'s a verbally muted, utterly embodied performance. (Provided by FilmDistrict)\nOnly Driver\'s not merely a mechanic. And Irene\'s not free. Newly paroled husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) arrives to complicate matters with a triangle that is tender and tortured.\n "Drive" revisits the familiar precinct of honor and betrayal among thieves. Woefully bereft of the luck of the Irish, Shannon still works the angles. He brings in Bernie (Brooks) as an investor in a stock car. His pitch: Driver. Nino (Perl man) is Bernie\'s nastier business-partner-in- crime. They\'ll all overlap in ways that recall the snarky madness of "Get Shorty" before giving in to a bloodletting worthy of Tarantino, although when "Drive" turns violent, it\'s never gleefully so.\n Gosling has done aching turns in a slew of idiosyncratic indies, from "Half Nelson," about a public-school teacher with a drug addiction; to "Lars and the Real Girl," about a guy who courts a blow-up doll; to last year\'s marital smashup "Blue Valentine." Here, he gives his character a "just visiting this planet" demeanor. It\'s a verbally muted, utterly embodied performance.\n Driver watches. Then he watches some more. When Irene and Benicio show up at the garage where he works, a nearly imperceptible smile gives way to something felt. \n In reworking genres without quoting shamelessly, Refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didn\'t even know we wanted to go.'}, {'url': u'http://www.detnews.com/article/20110916/ENT02/109160337/1034/ent02/Review--%E2%80%98Drive%E2%80%99-is-a-sharp-turn', 'rating': 3, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Tom Long', 'text': 'Ryan Gosling moves into a tough guy role in Drive, which won director Nicolas Winding Refn the best director award at this years Cannes Film Festival.

Don\'t get behind the wheel unless you can take the rush.\nSeriously, this is one ride you don\'t want to take if you\'re squeamish at all. It\'s intense, it\'s stylish, it\'s really well-acted and it\'s incredibly violent. But not at first.\nRyan Gosling stars as Driver, a stunt wheelman for Hollywood films who doubles as a getaway specialist at night. He\'s for hire, he gives you a small allotment of time to get the job done, and he gets you out.\nHe also doesn\'t say much. You don\'t know whether he\'s shy, bunched up or just disinterested. No matter what, he\'s no talker.\nHe works with Shannon (Bryan Cranston), a mechanic who fixes him up with day jobs and equips him for the dirty work. Shannon has dreams of getting Driver  the best he\'s ever seen  on a race track, so he convinces a gangster, Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks), to back him with a race car.\nBernie\'s longtime partner in crime, Nino (Ron Perlman), isn\'t so sure about the venture. Driver, as usual, seems indifferent.\nDisturbing Driver\'s indifference, though, is Irene (Carey Mulligan), a neighbor Driver meets and eventually befriends. She\'s raising her small son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), on her own while her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail. The three become a sort of platonic family, with the possibility of romance lingering.\nThen Standard gets out of jail. Driver seems to make peace with this, but then thugs come after Standard, wanting money he owes them. They threaten his family unless he does a job for them. Hoping to protect Irene and Benicio, Driver consents to man the getaway car.\nThen it all goes terribly wrong, and Driver\'s tightly controlled life goes skidding out of control.\nDirector Nicolas Winding Refn won the best director award at this year\'s Cannes Film Festival for "Drive," and it\'s easy to see why: He takes the film through its paces as if he\'s shifting a fine-tuned car. The film idles here and there, then it switches gears and goes from 0-80 in a second  yet he never loses control.\nUntil the end.\nThe screenplay, written by Hossein Amini and based on a book by James Sallis, is taut tough-guy stuff, but it plows into a wall of senseless noir clichs in the final minutes. It doesn\'t ruin the movie, but it sure doesn\'t help it.\nHelping it immensely are the actors. This is really an art house action movie, certainly not your typical shoot-\'em-up, so wouldn\'t you know the talented and idiosyncratic Gosling would choose it for a move into a tough guy role? Mulligan is as tender as ever, and while Brooks is rightfully garnering big praise for his gangster role, Perlman is right there with him.\nAside from the ending, "Drive" is a thinking man\'s crime fest, assuming that thinking man doesn\'t mind quite a bit of gore. Still, it\'s a study in controlled obsession let loose. Driver is a driven man fighting to keep control of the wheel.\n\'Drive\'\nRated R for strong brutal bloody violence, language and some nudity'}, {'url': u'http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/drive-a-dark-stylish-reinvention-of-the-car-chase/article2167536/', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Rick Groen', 'text': 'By day, hes a stunt driver for the movies; by night, a getaway driver for crooks. Happily, we begin on his night shift, in the darkened streets of L.A, with a masterful opening sequence that accomplishes the near-impossible: Damned if it doesnt reinvent the car-chase clich, not by tramping on the accelerator but by stomping on the brake. This is no antic-frantic affair; instead, its a cerebral game of stop-and-go, hide-and-seek, as the director behind the camera handles things exactly like the guy behind the wheel  with a stylish mixture of cold calculation and cool aplomb. \n  Media\n  Drive: The official trailer \n \n That director is Nicolas Winding Refn, the Dane who established both his visual cred and his bloody-mindedness in the Pusher trilogy and Bronson. As for the wheelman, his sole name is Driver, which gives you an idea of where matters are heading  yep, toward that gruesome point where high style collides with pulp content. Its a fun ride, at least until the fun turns, well, funny  risibly so  but thats always a danger in this genre. Sometimes, minus any warning, our suspended disbelief just plummets with a laughable thud. \n Early on, though, weve got Ryan Gosling to marvel at anew. His understated brand of acting, minimalist but magnetic, is perfect for the role. The laconic Driver is meant to be a cipher who, like the big-engine stock cars he admires, hides his roaring beast within a conventional exterior. That sub-textual tension has us intrigued, especially when he starts a polite flirtation with the pretty young mom (Carey Mulligan) living next door, the one whose imprisoned husband is slated for release. Soon enough, hubby appears and proves to be a hitherto loose cannon trying hard to tighten up, a sincere effort undermined by the fact that hes deep in hock to a couple of unforgiving mobsters. \n His predicament kick-starts the plot, which sees Driver contributing his automotive skills to a pawn-shop heist. Cue the double crosses, the messy complications, the accumulating pile of bodies shot to the head, or stabbed in the heart, or, less elegantly, reduced by vigorous stomping to grape-hued mush. To this stage, Goslings blue-eyed stare, Mulligans conflicted sweetness, some splendidly creepy supporting work by Albert Brooks as the loquacious mob boss, and Refns noir-in-colour panache have all combined to keep the dirty business humming smartly along. \n Oops, then comes the collision, when too much style gets vanquished by too little content. For example, Drivers inner beast is sporadically present but never accounted for. In the absence of any motivation or back-story, Gosling is left to play him with a simple on-off switch  nice guy one second, grape-stomper the next (the laugh-out-loud moment). Refn counters by doing what visually talented directors always do in substantively bankrupt circumstances  cranking up the style-meter even higher, fortifying the violence with lyrical slow-mo borrowed from Peckinpah, or shadowy knife-fights copped from Welles. The result? Just more uninvited chuckles. \n Still, lets be generous here. Drive is noirishly attractive until it stalls, and inadvertently amusing after. In other words, theres always something  this is a flick that does us right even when it goes wrong.'}, {'url': u'http://www.film.com/movies/review-drive-delivers', 'rating': 4, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Laremy Legel', 'text': "Member of the BFCA and OFCS, writer of criticism, noted interviewer, box office oracle, walker of dog named Bugsy, Qui audet adipiscitur.\n \nReview: Drive Delivers \n Laremy Legel September 16, 2011\n \nBuilding, building, building the tension - that's the goal of Drive.\nGreat point guards bring their own pace to a game. Theyll take you herky-jerky, stop-start your ankles, quick then smooth, keeping you off-balance until you dont have any clue what speed is coming at you next. This is what Drive does, and to its eternal credit, what Drive is. The pace of this film is a beautiful thing to behold, as Drive is a patient but taut thriller.\nRyan Gosling is a driver. Hell give you five minutes of wheel time, keep you safe, delivering you to your destination with style. He wears driving gloves and has a stopwatch, and hes very serious about his profession. The opening scenes of Drive show Gosling at his most precise, evading the police after a warehouse heist. It should be noted that this isnt a car chase movie  its far superior, because its all about the technique (which ideally, you wont sweat). After the heist, the cops are on the hunt and Gosling has to do his thing. Driver (the film grants him no name) occasionally just stops driving all together, letting the momentum of the authorities in pursuit carry them away from his clients. At other moments hes massively aggressive with his maneuvers, and these are the moments of ratcheted risks and pained grimaces. Building, building, building the tension  thats the goal of Drive, and it delivers throughout until eventually youre willing buyer of whatever it wants to sell you.\nEnter Carey Mulligan as Drivers next-door neighbor. She, like Driver, carries some battle scars, and they circle each other like tigers in a ring. The whole soundtrack is infused with a lovely 80s synth vibe, at once futuristic and nostalgic. Sublimely executed.\nProblems do (naturally) ensue, in the form of relationships gone awry on all sides. Drivers other job is as a mechanic, and his boss has dreams of him racing professionally. Unfortunately, to stake Drivers racing career he gets involved with some unsavory characters, for an unsavory loan with massively untenable terms. This is where Albert Brooks (as Bernie Rose) enters the fray, and hes never been better. Things arent too positive on the home front either as a shadowy figure from Mulligans past shows up at her door. Theres a child involved too, if only so we can see the melting of Goslings icy facade for a few moments.\nGosling, for his part, seems to mature as an actor minute by minute as the film plays out. Driver is a dangerous sort of man, blustery cold with unpredictable moments of boil, and Gosling plays it all like a Stradivarius, which is to say he uses the very capable tool hes been given in a masterful manner. The only real knock on Drive is that its occasionally violent, and there are those in our society who would prefer to avoid violence on film. Its a fair point, but I loved Drive, and I think you might too. Tense, well-acted, well-conceived, and well-executed, Drive is a pretty good example of what happens when exceptional skill meets opportunity."}, {'url': u'http://www.nj.com/entertainment/movies/index.ssf/2011/09/drive_review_pedal_to_the_metal.html', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Stephen Whitty', 'text': 'His home is a nearly empty L.A. apartment.

Playing a Hollywood stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman for criminals, he rocks like a young Steve McQueen or Robert De Niro.\n The film rolls like a hybrid of Bullitt and Taxi Driver, with Gosling stepping up his game and demonstrating his chops as an action anti-hero in the speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick vein.\n The only name available for his character is Driver, and he has a very simple and unbreakable rule of transport for his crooked clientele. Hell wait five minutes and five minutes only, no more or no less, for them to do their dirty work and hop back inside to evade the cops. \n While waiting, Driver checks the time on an analog wristwatch, which seems oddly imprecise, and listens to a ball game in between police reports on his mobile scanner.

I drive.\n He doesnt explain himself, just like his namesake in the pulpy James Sallis novella that screenwriter Hossein Amini draws from. You can read the book in almost the same amount time as the film runs, 100 minutes. \n But its clear Driver sees himself as an action figure in a movie, set in the 1980s but also drawing inspiration from the 1970s. Its appropriate that another of Drives obvious influences is Walter Hills The Driver, released in 1978, which straddled the two decades.\n Driver chews on a toothpick like Al Pacino in Serpico, and his silk silver jacket is emblazoned with a scorpion, making him seem like a kid trying to be a superhero.\n And he is, like Aaron Johnson in Kick-Ass or Rainn Wilson in Super, except hes not kidding around. His day job as a stunt driver is about creating Hollywood fantasies, but his night job as a criminal wheelman is dangerous and brutal reality.\n Drivers skills are almost supernatural, and Shannon sells him exactly this way: You put this kid behind the wheel, theres nothing he cant do.\n Shannon is speaking to mob leader Bernie Rose, whom funnyman Albert Brooks plays with a coiled menace no one would have expected from him.\n Theres a deal in the works to have Rose purchase an expensive muscle car that Driver will race for more  even though money doesnt motivate him.\n Driver has a violent streak in him  watch out for those boots  but hes a romantic at heart, even if his heart barely seems to beat. He has his eye on Irene (Carey Mulligan), a single mother who needs his help. Hell do anything to assist her, and anything is really something, especially when best-laid plans turn sour.\n Drive is a movie of oil, blood and bone and not for the easily offended.\n Anyone who has seen Refns earlier movies Bronson, Valhalla Rising and the Pusher trilogy know of the Danish directors love of extreme violence, even when it isnt strictly necessary for a scene. Refn, who won a prize at Cannes for Drive, spent his formative years haunting grindhouse cinemas in New York, where he lived for a spell.\n He also loves music, often making choices that seem illogical on paper but work so well on screen. A case in point is Cliff Martinezs pulsing score for Drive, which is supplemented with current acts paying tribute to 80s synth-pop sounds.\n Drive doesnt reinvent the wheel of the automobile action movie but it certainly revs the engine. \n The two words for action satisfaction this fall? \n I drive.'}, {'url': u'http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/drive,1111797/critic-review.html', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Ann Hornaday', 'text': 'Star of the moment Ryan Gosling delivers a slow, white-hot burn of a performance in "Drive," a nervy, understated ode to one of Hollywood\'s most cherished archetypes, the sad-eyed man of few words.\n They can be cowboys, hit men or, in this case, loners who drive cars for a living. But no matter how chilly and reserved, the mysteries at their core mesmerize rather than repel.\n As a getaway driver known only as Driver, Gosling obviously harks back to similar protagonists played by Ryan O\'Neal, Lee Marvin, Robert De Niro and especially Steve McQueen. \n But in "Drive," Gosling and director Nicolas Winding Refn neatly manage the hat trick of paying homage to those wheelmen of yore while reinvigorating the genre with style, smarts and flashes of wit. You may still want to fasten your seat belts, but in these capable, seductive hands you\'re in for a smooth, uncommonly assured ride.\n That\'s made clear in the opening sequence of "Drive," when Gosling\'s character fetches two thieves from a Los Angeles warehouse. Found out by the police, who begin to pursue them by way of patrol cars and a helicopter, Driver leads the fuzz not on the wheel-screeching, bombastic chase audience might expect, but on a quiet, cat-and-mouse prowl through Los Angeles\'s nighttime back streets, winding up in the endless proscenium arches of a parking garage. \n At once classic and refreshingly new, the sequence establishes Driver\'s watchful calm and psychic mettle, as well as Refn\'s indisputable chops as a filmmaker with firm command of tone, rhythm and irresistibly propulsive pacing.\n It turns out that Driver\'s getaway gig is just a sideline; his day job becomes clear in one of the all-time great movie "reveals," which makes "Drive" not just a fast-car action picture but a wry commentary on Hollywood artifice (which will come in handy later when someone covered in blood needs to blend in with a crowd). \n Carey Mulligan, as Driver\'s new neighbor Irene, may be completely miscast as the wife of a low-level criminal named Standard (the terrific Oscar Isaac), but her chemistry with Gosling is entirely believable, not least because Refn chooses to convey it through lyrical sequences of shy glances and wordlessly eloquent gestures.\n Far more persuasive, however improbably, is Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose, a seedy criminal middle-manager who like everyone in L.A. tried his hand in the biz, in his case as a producer. "One critic called them European," he wistfully recalls of his movies. Later, in one of the movie\'s most chilling scenes, he sweet-talks and soothes a hapless victim while he quietly slips a shiv in his arm, effecting a flawless balance between nebbishness and menace.\n Refn, a Danish director whose previous films include "Bronson" and "Valhalla Rising," is known for his love of blood, and when the plot of "Drive" quickens he finds plenty of chances to indulge in his penchant for lurid, stylized violence. But even his most fetishized flourishes are tempered here, not just with the tender love story between Irene and Driver but with Refn\'s newfound restraint (one pivotal murderous episode occurs entirely in shadow).\n After skillfully earning the audience\'s allegiance, "Drive," which is based on the novel by James Sallis, throws its hero\'s motives into more troubling ambiguity, with Gosling\'s grievous angel proving to be capable of startling brutality. Like the scorpion on his jacket, he can\'t escape his nature, and Refn does a good job of keeping that core moral essence opaque until the explosive end. He\'s also constructed a perfect showcase for Gosling\'s hangdog charisma, which has come into its own this year first with "Crazy, Stupid, Love" and next with "The Ides of March."\n A poster for the latter has his face morphing with George Clooney\'s, and the comparison is apt; indeed "Drive" recalls two of Clooney\'s best and recent movies, "Michael Clayton" and "The American." \n Like "Michael Clayton," "Drive" is a hushed, methodical ode to competence, a wistful wish-fulfillment fantasy in an age of mass screw-uppery. Like "The American," it\'s almost abstract in its willingness to eschew conventional plotting and dialogue for a subtle sound design and crisp, clean imagery.\n Most important, like Clooney\'s best movies, "Drive" features a compulsively watchable cipher at its center. Low-key, sleek and sophisticated, "Drive" provides the visceral pleasures of pulp without sacrificing art. It\'s cool and smart. Some critics might even call it European.\nContains strong brutal bloody violence and some nudity.'}, {'url': u'http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/man_on_transmission_4aYOolWcjHr2RBT0WP0ZIL?CMP=OTC-rss&FEEDNAME=', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Lou Lumenick', 'text': 'Early reviews out of Cannes proclaimed Danish director Nicolas Winding Refns Hollywood debut, Drive, a full-blooded return to such 60s thrillers as Bullitt and Point Blank.

It\'s a film in love with both traditional noir mythology and ultra-modern violence, a combination that is not ideal.\n Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn won the best director award at Cannes, and it\'s easy to see why this tale of an emotionless wheelman (Ryan Gosling) who lives to drive and makes a rare stab at human connection with a fetching neighbor took the prize. Impeccably shot by Newton Thomas Sigel, "Drive" always looks dressed to kill. Making fine use of Los Angeles locations, particularly the lonely downtown streets around the L.A. River, "Drive" has a slick, highly romanticized pastel look calculated to win friends and influence people.\n Less user-friendly is the film\'s disturbing violence. "Drive" doesn\'t spend a lot of time on mayhem, but what does get put on screen is intense, unsettling and increasingly grotesque and graphic as the film goes on.\n For fans of director Refn, known among chaos aficionados for made-in-Europe violent fare like "The Pusher" trilogy and "Bronson," this is bloody business as usual. But the mayhem here so clashes with the high style and traditionalism of the rest of the film that when the bloodletting goes into overdrive, so to speak, it throws you out of the picture, diluting the mood rather than enhancing it.\n Certainly there could be no more familiar character to movie fans than the film\'s protagonist, so iconic he\'s reminiscent of Alain Delon\'s Jef Costello in Jean-Pierre Melville\'s classic "Le Samourai" and as written by Hossein Amini from the James Sallis novel so self-consciously mythologized he doesn\'t even have a name.\n Coolly played by Gosling, the driver is a monosyllabic loner with a monotone voice, a toothpick in his mouth, and a fondness for a silver racing jacket with a giant yellow scorpion on the back. By day he works in a garage on Reseda Boulevard run by hard luck Shannon ("Breaking Bad\'s" Bryan Cranston) and does stunt driving for the movies. Once the sun goes down, he drives getaway cars for criminal types.\n "There are 100,000 streets in this city," the driver says, echoing the famous "there are 8 million stories in the naked city" line of yore. Just tell him where and when to pick you up  and don\'t even think about making him wait more than five minutes  and he promises to ferry you to safety. For a price.\n "Drive" opens with what might be its most successful, least violent set piece, a getaway from a robbery choreographed to quietly insistent techno music by Johnny Jewel. As he plays cat and mouse with L.A.\'s finest, the driver reveals himself to be a highly proficient, emotionless technician with nerves of tempered steel. When the man pulls on his leather driving gloves, it\'s best to get out of the way.\n Trying to keep as low a profile as possible, the driver lives in an apartment building next to MacArthur Park and shops in the picturesque Big 6 supermarket nearby. To say that he is closed off to all forms of human emotion is putting it very mildly indeed.\n But, hey, wouldn\'t you know it, living right down the hall from the driver is Irene (Carey Mulligan, underutilized), an attractive young woman who does have a name. She also has a young son named Benicio (Kaden Leos) who the driver inexplicably takes a fatherly interest in. Whatever this film\'s strengths, psychological motivation is not one of them.\n \n Before this platonic idyll can get out of first gear, Irene\'s husband Standard (the gifted Oscar Isaac) comes back from the prison where he\'s been conveniently warehoused and the driver prepares to retreat into his mythic shell.\n But wait. Standard comes home to trouble with some bad guys, bad guys who make the mistake of threatening Irene and young Benicio. Ever the knight errant, the driver volunteers his help, but everything starts to go wrong in ways that lead to all that bloodshed.\n Though many aspects of "Drive" are, for better or worse, intentionally familiar, there is one element that is different, and that is Albert Brooks\' performance as Bernie Rose, a genial but dangerous criminal of the driver\'s acquaintance. The actor brings a fine air of scornful, eccentric menace to the role.

Nothing else is revealed about him. In other films, this lack of back story could be a handicap. Here, it's no impediment; the present is so tense that audiences are caught up only in the pulse-quickening moment.\nDriver seems to have almost sprung into life as a coiled, confident and closed-off man. It's hard to imagine him having a childhood. So, his unexpected bond with Irene (Carey Mulligan), a sweet young mother who lives in his apartment building, and her sad-eyed little boy is all the more intriguing.\nThe film opens with Gosling calmly maneuvering a getaway car for a pair of thieves. He knows downtown L.A. so well that he outwits a platoon of squad cars and helicopters.\nDriver dabbles in criminal jobs by night, but during the daylight hours, he is an agile stunt driver and mechanic. He has a set of personal ethics that govern his association with the unsavory types he abets. His services are a limited-time offer. He'll assist their escape for only a number of minutes. After that, they're on their own.\nIn the hands of a lesser actor, Driver could have been an empty vessel. But Gosling pumps the minimalist character with brooding complexity. \nDanish-born director Nicolas Winding Refn's tight camera angles on Gosling's soulful eyes or clenched jaw serve to heighten the trance-like quality of the film. This art-house crime saga has a distinctly European sensibility. The film slows down to a deliberate pace, then revs on a dime to frantic speeds. Drenched in strikingly violent imagery, it may be off-putting for the squeamish.\nBreaking Bad's Bryan Cranston plays Driver's manager. Albert Brooks cleverly plays against type as a vicious mobster. \nDrive has an almost moralistic fairy-tale quality amid the graphic violence.

His influences seem to change in every scene, from Michael Mann to John Woo to any moviemaker who ever directed Steve McQueen. Refn casts Christina Hendricks and somehow makes her look a little frumpy. After teasing the audience with two excellent car chases, our antihero barely breaks the speed limit in the second half of the film.\n And still, with its excess of carnage and stubborn lack of focus, the film is very satisfying. Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by "Drive," while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you\'re in before you enter the theater. \n Refn has been making challenging independent cinema for years and is well regarded for his uncompromising work on films such as "Bronson" and the "Pusher" trilogy. He was reportedly hand-picked by actor Ryan Gosling for "Drive." Apparently, the red-hot Gosling thought his career would benefit from less talking and more smashing people with a hammer. \n Gosling is the nameless protagonist, who does Hollywood stunt work by day and moonlights as a getaway driver by night. He meets a beautiful neighbor (Carey Mulligan) with a desperate ex-con husband. He\'s introduced to a pair of low-level mob bosses (Ron Perlman, and the shockingly menacing Albert Brooks). For a few minutes, you\'ll swear the film is headed in the Tom Cruise/"Days of Thunder" stock-car film direction. Plans go awry, and the driver is on the run, using his skills, wits and a horror movie villain\'s relentless force to achieve his goals. \n A tense cat-and-mouse game with the police opens the film. A more muscular car chase shows up near the midway point. But just when you\'re sure this is the industry\'s best car-stunt film since "Ronin" in 1998, Refn changes focus again, and the mayhem rises to unexpected heights. The squeamish probably shouldn\'t go to "Drive" - or at least should acclimate themselves by watching "Eastern Promises" a few times.\n The complaints are minor and varied. Mulligan is beautiful but seems too fragile and passive for her role. Refn goes overkill on the long pauses - he would have had time for that epic third car chase if he eliminated half the slow motion in this film. \n The visuals are otherwise outstanding, featuring little-seen parts of Los Angeles, shot in wide angles with a steady hand. The music choices and Cliff Martinez score reimagines early 1980s pop music, minus the overproduction and sappy lyrics.\n Gosling continues his streak of excellent performances that are completely different from the previous one. Only an actor with incredible confidence would be willing to crib so much from Stallone\'s Marion Cobretti in the 1986 film "Cobra," and somehow make it work. Brooks may be even better, mostly because he has the element of surprise.

There\'s also plenty of blood-letting, standoffs, shootouts and wordless mini-meditations on men and criminality. Yet it\'s the movie\'s threateningly low hum while it sits idling that really gets you.\nGosling\'s driver is never identified, though his garage mechanic employer Shannon (Bryan Cranston) calls him "kid." A man of fewer-than-few words, the kid is behind the wheel when a movie needs a spectacular crash. In his off hours, he\'s a wheelman for hire, zipping around and through shadowy Los Angeles streets, aiding and abetting robberies for a price.\nA normally careful guy, the driver is Shannon\'s way out of a dead-end life when a low-rent crime boss named Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) agrees to backing a stock car design Shannon has developed. But Rose and his thuggish partner (Ron Perlman) are unscrupulous and murderous, and, unknown to everyone, have a connection to the pretty neighbor (Carey Mulligan) who has cracked the driver\'s tough shell.\nDirected by the acceleratedly named Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, winner of the Best Director prize at Cannes, "Drive" is set in the present-day but has a quirky \'80s fixation in lighting, music and mood that could have stalled it. Refn\'s choice in neon lights and obscure synth-pop wind up putting "Drive" in the company of that era\'s "Thief" and "Manhunter," while other elements link it with "F/X" and even "American Gigolo." It\'s a risky move, but it pays off.\nAnd though Mulligan is miscast as a hard-luck mother awaiting her husband\'s parole, Gosling is eerily magnetic, and gets great support from Cranston, Perlman, Christina Hendricks (as a Tarantino-trashy burglary accessory) and, especially, Brooks.

With Ryan Gosling ably incarnating a pent-up man of few words who goes to great lengths to make one positive gesture in a rotten world, Danish wunderkind Nicolas Winding Refn has fashioned an atmospheric and engaging glorified potboiler that nonetheless seems powered by a half-empty creative tank. Not the sort of film normally seen in the competition at Cannes, this moody and bloody entry should be promotable to good box office results from both discerning and popcorn audiences come September.\nour editor recommends\n \n Never speaking unless absolutely necessary, Goslings unnamed Driver works doing movie stunts during the day and moonlights as a robbery getaway driver. The sharply executed opening sequence shows Drivers complete mastery of Los Angeles streets, as well as his grace under pressure, as he threads his way through a net of police cars and helicopters to escape from a nocturnal warehouse break-in.\n Drawn to an appealing neighborin his near-downtown apartment building, Irene (Carey Mulligan), Driver does more talking with his eyes than with his mouth. An initial exchange between them sums up the semi-philosophical, borderline hilarious sort of dialogue that often finds its way into this kind of fare. Irene: Whaddya do? Driver: I drive.\n We never learn much more about the man than that, but he quickly takes a strong interest in the welfare of this young woman, who has a cute young son (Kaden Leos) whose dad is in prison. At the same time, it appears that Drivers professional fortunes might be improving, as his longtime boss and patron, gimpy-legged auto shop owner Shannon (Bryan Cranston) makes a deal with big-bucks investor Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) to back Driver as a stock car racer.\n When Irenes man, named Standard (Oscar Isaac), is released, he expresses regret over his former actions and genuine appreciation for his shot at a second chance. However, an unpaid debt, unknown links to Bernies vulgar criminal pal Nino (Ron Perlman), a botched robbery and deeply entrenched venality on several fronts pull Driver into a treacherous underworld that ultimately requires far more of him than his driving skill.\n The lulls between set pieces tend to be quiet and moody, which dramatically offsets the efficiently executed car chases and the killings that mount up -- and become increasing gory -- as the bad deeds multiply. The downtime never threatens to become dull, not with this cast nor with Refns lively style and the wildly eclectic soundtrack thats embedded in techno music but extends well beyond it.\n All the same, Hossein Aminis adaptation of James Sallis short novel feels more threadbare than bracingly terse; he's clearly aspiring to the sort of spare muscularity in crime writing pioneered by Hemingway in The Killers and subsequently employed by many others. Amini simply doesnt build enough subtext and layering beneath the surface of the characters and dialogue; the tough talk is simply not loaded the way it is in the best noirs, so the lack of resonance is manifest.\n Possibly for the same reason, something analogous takes place visually as well. Refn, who has built himself a substantial following on the basis of such stylishly powerful works as the Pusher trilogy, Bronson and Valhalla Rising, creates a strong imprint with his vision of a dark, seamy L.A. (Newton Thomas Sigel was the resourceful cinematographer), and the violence increasingly goes beyond what you expect. But there are no sequences here that thrill or absolutely kick butt in the maximum genre way (except for the creative manner some killings are done). The good stuff here is quite good, but it doesnt reach the highest level.\n So its a fun, if not exhilarating, ride, one sped along with the help of a wonderfully assembled cast. Gosling here makes a bid to enter the iconic ranks of tough, self-possessed American screen actors -- Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Lee Marvin -- who express themselves through actions rather than words. Sometimes (mostly around Irene), his Driver smiles too much, but Gosling assumes just the right posture of untroubled certainty in the driving scenes and summons unsuspected reserves when called upon for very rough stuff later on.\n Mulligan, seen only in classy fare up to now, is a delightful choice as the sweet but bereft Irene, while Isaac invests his jailbird with unanticipated intelligence and sincerity. Christina Hendricks isnt around for long but makes a strong impression as an accomplice in an ill-advised robbery. Cranston applies craggy color to his good-guy loser, while Perlman pushes the evil all the way. Most surprising of all, however, is Brooks, who is wonderful as a rich, reasonable-sounding gent whos better than the others at hiding that hes a total s.o.b.\n Venue: Cannes Film Festival, Competition\nSales: Sierra/Affinity\nRelease: Sept. 16 (Film District)"}, {'url': u'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903927204576572542212463116.html?mod=WSJ_ArtsEnt_LifestyleArtEnt_2', 'rating': 3, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Joe Morgenstern', 'text': 'The laconic hero of "Drive" is known only as The Driver. That may give you some sense of this highly stylized, often beautiful and graphically violent action drama about a mechanic and part-time movie stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman. It will be an incomplete sense, though. Depending on the second-by-second circumstances, The Driver might also be called The Lover, Dreamer, Benefactor, Brute or Killerhe\'s actually all of those things in the time and space of a single elevator ride. Few actors working today could make emotional sense of such a protean character, but Ryan Gosling does so with calm authority. He\'s a formidable presence in a film that grabs your gaze and won\'t let go except for moments when you can\'t help but look away.\n       \n"Drive" was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn from Hossein Amini\'s adaptation of a noirish novel by James Sallis. Mr. Refn, born in Denmark but a New Yorker since childhood, brought a Continental flair to several violent features, starting with the 1996 "Pusher," that have earned him a cult following. (In "Drive," a pitiless thug claims to have produced sexy action movies in the 1980s: "One critic," he says dryly, "called them \'European.\'") This penchant for suspenseful mayhem gives pace and shape to a story that otherwise wouldn\'t be much more than a tone poem. After befriending Irene (Carey Mulligan), a neighbor whose husband is in prison, The Driver finds himself in an awkward position when the husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released and comes home. Then his impulsive generosity puts him in a perilous position vis--vis ruthless crooks who are using him in ways he can\'t comprehend.\n                      \n  Watch a clip from the film "Drive," starring Ryan Gosling. Video courtesy of FilmDistrict.\n                \nThat peril, like the action flowing from it, is intensea hold-up gone bad; car chases through the streets of Los Angeles; car combat that involves some spectacular driving in reverse; car characterization that puts the way-cool hero into an unassuming Chevy Impala with 300 horses hidden under the hood or, later, a spirited, stolen Mustang, and the bad guys into a massive, hunch-shouldered Chrysler 300 sedan. I won\'t describe the mayhem in detail, because I don\'t want you looking away from the page.\n The tone-poem parts are pretty wonderful too, thanks to Newton Thomas Sigel\'s cinematography, which is gorgeous even when the camera is only surveying flat surfaces; to the sound track, which ranges from ecstatic harmonies to overmodulations that sound like a car\'s harsh exhaust note, and to the director\'s fondness for enchanted, attenuated encounters, as in the moments, which go from slo-mo to no-mo, when The Driver and Irene first meet. "Drive" matches the nakedly brutal (an explosion of violence in a nightclub that evokes Weimar decadence) with the scruffily lyrical (The Driver taking Irene and her sweetly soulful young son Beniciohe\'s played by Kaden Leosfor a drive down the barely moist cement channel of the Los Angeles River.)\n Most of the supporting performances are flawless. Ms. Mulligan gives Irene an air of bittersweet expectancy; you\'re not sure, because Irene isn\'t sure, whether she\'s awaiting pleasure or pain. Mr. Isaac uses the astutely written specifics of the husband\'s role to make him likable as well as memorable. Christina Hendricks\'s Blanche is so much a moll that she should have been called The Moll. As the thug who once produced movies, Albert Brooks is both the essence of simplicity and evil incarnate; it\'s a small but sensational performance. Ron Perlman, by contrast, is intrusively grotesque as another murderous monster, though the way he\'s photographed suggests that it\'s not his fault. The director, unduly taken by his actor\'s singular physiognomy, may have allowed or encouraged the excess.\n Then there\'s Mr. Gosling, and the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. It\'s irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando; like Brando, he has a surprisingly light, even boyish voice that can seem to be escaping his throat, rather than being sent forth from it. But peerless though Brando was, he could be mannered to the point of self-parody. That hasn\'t happened to Mr. Gosling. He keeps it fresh, whether it\'s the droll self-assurance of his womanizer in "Crazy, Stupid, Love" or the doomily seductive inwardness of The Driver in "Drive." He and this powerful film, which is ultimately about a moment of grace, deserve each other. He\'s the medium\'s most graceful minimalist.\n \'Happy, Happy\'\nIn her casually daringand mostly endearingdebut feature, the Norwegian director Anne Sewitsky mixes and purposely mismatches light and dark moods to tell the story of a rural wife and mother looking for happiness in the wrong places, and finally in the right one. (The film, which was written by Ragnhild Tronvoll, is Norway\'s foreign-language entry in this year\'s Academy Awards.) Kaja, who\'s vulnerable in ways we can only intuit at first, is played with unsettling good cheer by Agnes Kittelsen. She\'s the picture of domestic contentment, as well as generous hospitality, when a couple of urban sophisticates, Sigve and Elisabeth, and their adopted Ethiopian son Noa move into the house next to hers. (They\'re played by Henrik Rafaelsen, Maibritt Saerens and Ram Shihab Ebedy. Joachim Rafaelsenno relationis Eirik, Kaja\'s prickly husband.) Soon enough, though, the mood darkens, the sexual plot thickens and both women start to reveal the separate but equal sadness that swirls beneath the surface of their lives.\n         Enlarge Image \n Close \n                                           Magnolia Pictures         Agnes Kittelsen as Kaja in \'Happy, Happy.\'\n       \n"Happy, Happy" won\'t make you happy if you hold to the notion that a movie can be funny or serious, but not both. And particularly not both at the same time, as in several eerie scenes that find Kaja\'s and Eirik\'s young son, Theodor, playing master and slave with Noa. Yet those scenes furnish fair comment on other kinds of enslavementto the idealized notion of family, to the desperate need for lovethat has kept Kaja from the happiness she has always craved. \n Perhaps another comment is too obviously on the nose when Kaja, a timid soloist with a local church choir, gets to sing "Amazing Grace," with those familiar lines "I once was lost but now am found." Still more comment is dispensed, sporadically and amusingly, by a gospel quartet with an amazing bass, and even by President Barack Obama, who, watched by Noa on a notebook computer, says it may come as no surprise, given the "dizzying pace of globalization," that "people fear the loss of what they cherish." The movie doesn\'t need all that explication, though it doesn\'t really get in the way. Kaja explains herself eloquently in the course of discovering herself. \nA stressogenic comedy about stress, this screen version of Allison Pearson\'s debut novel stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Kate Reddy, a superachiever struggling to juggle the demands of motherhood and career. Her juggling act excludes surprises; every ball, plate and dumbbell comes down exactly where you expect it to. And every scene is clearly labeled in Aline Brosh McKenna\'s screenplay, which resembles nothing so much as a PowerPoint presentationthis means this, that means thatwith bullet points emphasized by on-camera interviews of the heroine\'s friends and associates. (The two men in her life, earnest husband and cautiously amorous business partner, are played by Greg Kinnear and Pierce Brosnan.)\n         Enlarge Image \n       \nDoes Kate\'s insane striving, both as a mother and financial analyst, reflect the contemporary lives of real people? It does indeed. On a long flight last weekend, I watched a scarily earnest mother use one of those your-baby-can-read books to teach vocabulary words to her six-month-old daughter, who stared at the pages in total bafflement. And the inside of a working woman\'s head may well be, as one of Kate\'s friends says, like the control tower at O\'Hare airport. (The friend who says itChristina Hendricks in perky mode has no useful role in the action; she\'s just there for clever comments.)\n But the movie, which was directed by Douglas McGrath, establishes Kate\'s basicand by now banalconflict early on, then never stops for a moment\'s reflection, as distinct from explanation. Long after lice from her children\'s school infested Kate\'s scalp, I was scratching my head about why a 91-minute movie seemed so long. The answer came from reframing the question. Why was a string of sitcom problems stretched to 91 minutes?\n\'They Drive by Night\' (1940)      \n         Enlarge Image \n                                         \nRaoul Walsh\'s film is really two films uncomfortably combined, as everyone has noted since its release seven decades ago. One half, with George Raft, Humphrey Bogart and Alan Hale, is about independent truck drivers trying to make an honest living. The other, with its standard-brand melodramatics, is dominated by Ida Lupino\'s going-mad scene in a courtroom. Not to be confused with Nicholas Ray\'s vastly superior 1948 feature "They Live By Night," which was adapted from an Edward Anderson novel that was also the progenitor of Robert Altman\'s marvelous and grievously underappreciated 1974 film "Thieves Like Us."\n \'O\'Horten\' (2007)      \nAn early scene in Bent Hamer\'s humane comedy, in Norwegian with English subtitles, depicts the power that the taciturn hero enjoys and will soon be forced to surrender. An engineer who must soon retire, Odd Horten sits serene at the controls of a sleek locomotive pulling a passenger train from Oslo to Bergen through a silent snowscape. The literal subject is retirement and the prospect of loss. But Mr. Hamer, a poet of the droll and askew, sends the aptly named Odd on a cockeyed journey from regret through comic confusion to a lovely eagerness for new adventures.\nDuring a cheerful interlude of lawn archery in Douglas McGrath\'s screen version of Jane Austen\'s comic tour de force, one of the heroine\'s arrows lands in the grass below a big, overstuffed target. If the arrow is emblematic of Emma\'s penchant for missing the point in human affairs, it\'s also the only thing that falls significantly short of the mark in this deftly understated production, with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role. An American actress and an American director in his feature debut have made a Jane Austen movie that outshines its predecessors by not trying to shine at all.'}, {'url': u'http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2093404,00.html', 'rating': 3, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Jessica Winter', 'text': 'Ryan Gosling! Man or machine? Myth or miracle? Is there anything he can\'t do? He\'s George Clooney\'s heir apparent! He breaks up street fights on his way home from the gym! He has Photoshopped abs! He\'s the subject of the best Tumblr ever! He\'s the guy from The Notebook! But there\'s more and yet more; he contains multitudes. There is romantic Gosling (Crazy Stupid Love) and edgy Method Gosling (The Believer) and quirky indie Gosling (Lars and the Real Girl) and lumpen burnout Gosling (Blue Valentine) and psycho killer Gosling (Murder by Numbers).   \nBut who is Gosling qua Gosling? What is Gosling boiled down to purest Goslingness? What if there were a filmed entertainment that gave Gosling few words, fewer motivations and fewest expressions? Would these distilled vapors of the Gosling essence combust, causing fires in our theaters, swooning in our streets, hysterical blindness in our children? And would it matter that in this filmed entertainment, he doesn\'t take his shirt off even once?  \nDrive, a gleaming, goofy action-thriller from Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, is the first Goslingwerk to formulate Minimalist Gosling. He plays a near mute stuntman with a lucrative sideline as the getaway driver for robberies (the sinuous opening sequence lays out his command of nocturnal L.A. streets, cop-chase geography and  crucially for his thieving passengers  the Clippers\' home-game schedule). He has no friends, though he does have a squirrely employer (Bryan Cranston) who\'s in deep with a sulfurous gangster (Hellboy\'s Ron Perlman) and his ex-movie-producer associate (Albert Brooks, brilliantly cast). He has no girl of his own; he\'s smitten with the wistful mom down the hall (Carey Mulligan), but her husband is about to return home from prison. And he has no name, perhaps because there are too many names to choose from: "Driver" (as the credits call him) evokes the taciturn loner heroes of Eastwood, McQueen and the eponym of Walter Hill\'s The Driver (1978). See the All-TIME best car chases, including Steve McQueen in Bullitt. \nLike Gosling\'s Driver, Drive is to a great extent the sum of its influences. Refn, who has a passionate cult following and some unlikely art-house cred for his deliriously violent Pusher trilogy and Bronson, is a child of the 1980s. For him, To Live and Die in L.A. and the collected works of Michael Mann are sacred texts to be restaged (more slo-mo! More blood! More crunching of bone!) and Goslingized. If \'80s axiom Molly Ringwald had a custom font, it would be the jagged pink cursive of Drive\'s opening titles. Even the pop songs have the cocaine-cheesy sheen of a synth power ballad from the Miami Vice soundtrack. Minimalist Gosling has a heart, and it beats to a drum machine.  \nThat heart is big and strong and selfless! But it can express itself only through wicked steering maneuvers, fisticuffs and placid TV-watching with Mulligan\'s son. And crime: to get her hubby out of a pinch, Gosling agrees to a pro bono heist that goes awry as expected, leaving him holding a bag full of Perlman\'s and Brooks\' money. This is when the engines really start gunning and the heads really start exploding and the pearl-handled razors really start coming out. (By the way, if you want to see Christina Hendricks  Mad Men\'s Joan Holloway  in jeans and stilettos, here\'s your chance.) From the heist onward, Drive hits and maintains a steady rhythm of neon-lit paranoia punctuated by detonations of violence. The car chases are brisk and to the point. The murders are brisk and glutinous. (The most satisfying may be a twofer car crashdrowning that Gosling executes in a stuntman\'s cawl, when Drive for a moment becomes a lost entry in the Halloween franchise: Michael Myers Hits the Beach.) And the supporting players are B-movie bliss, leaving grit and grime on everything they touch. Surely there\'s a current crime serial (Boardwalk Empire? Cranston\'s Breaking Bad?) that could create a villain role for Brooks, who plays his psychopath as an irritable pragmatist with a curatorial eye for sharp objects. See Halloween in TIME\'s top 10 movie franchises.\n  Minimalist Gosling makes for a magnetic cyborg, and Minimalist Mulligan tries to match him: whether Gosling is just gazing at her (which he does a lot) or divesting a baddie\'s face from his jaw in an elevator (which he does only once), she arranges her face into a picture of sad-eyed amusement, with occasional variations of amused sadness. Their romance follows a chronology not of banter, flirtation and foreplay but stares and blinks. Refn\'s mix of grind-house horror with sweetie-pie sentiment is a recipe mastered by Takeshi Kitano (and, in his own way, David Lynch), but this director\'s brew is simpler, more direct, less cerebral and less heartfelt. To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship, or the movie itself, would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in one\'s car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast, why not?

Scott', 'text': "A long time ago, as a young filmmaker besotted with the hard-boiled pleasures of classic Hollywood, Jean-Luc Godard claimed that all anyone needed to make a film was a girl and a gun. In his new movie, Drive, Nicolas Winding Refn, in thrall to a later Hollywood tradition, tests out a slightly different formula. In this case all you need is a guy and a car.    \n                         \n   More About This Movie\n Overview\n   Tickets & Showtimes\n   New York Times Review\n   Cast, Credits & Awards\n   Readers' Reviews \n       Trailers & Clips                    View Clip...           \n   \n       Carey Mulligan as the girl who lives down the hall from the guy, and the sole innocent in a movie filled with film noir baddies.              \n \n       Ryan Gosling, the guy with no name in Drive, who is a virtuoso behind the wheel of a getaway car, a silver Chevy Impala.              \n \n                                                      In the brilliant opening sequence the formula seems to work beautifully. The car is, of all things, a late-model silver Chevy Impala, the kind of generic, functional ride you might rent at the airport on a business trip. The guy is Ryan Gosling  his character has no known proper name, and is variously referred to as the driver, the kid and him  and to watch him steer through Los Angeles at night is to watch a virtuoso at work. Behind the wheel of a getaway car after an uninteresting, irrelevant and almost botched robbery, the driver glides past obstacles and shakes off pursuers, slowing down as often as he accelerates and maintaining a steady pulse rate even as the soundtrack winds up the tension to heart attack levels.    \n                                                       The virtuosity on display is also the directors, of course, and that, for better and for worse, is pretty much the point of Drive, the coolest movie around and therefore the latest proof that cool is never cool enough. Mr. Winding Refn is a Danish-born director (Bronson, Valhalla Rising, the Pusher trilogy), some of whose earlier films have inspired ardent, almost cultish devotion in cinephile circles.    \n                                                       His own love of movies can hardly be doubted, and theres nothing wrong with his taste. He likes the stripped-down highway movies of the 1960s and 70s  the kind that Quentin Tarantino celebrated in Death Proof  and also the atmospheric masculine melancholy associated with Michael Mann. You might also catch a hint of Paul Schraders American Gigolo and, with respect to the story rather than to the visual style, a whole bunch of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone westerns.    \n                                                       Mr. Goslings driver, like Mr. Eastwoods Man With No Name, is a solitary figure with no background or connections but with skills that defy explanation. In addition to his getaway gigs, he drives stunt cars for movies  the source of a witty trompe loeil sequence early in the film  and might have a future on the racing circuit.    \n                                                       At least thats what his friend and sometime employer Shannon (Bryan Cranston) thinks. He has a plan to persuade a couple of local gangsters (Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks) to invest in a car that will be both Shannons and the drivers ticket out of their marginal, sun-baked, film noir existence.    \n                                                       You dont need me to tell you that the plan goes astray and that before too long the girl and the gun come into play, in more or less that order. The girls name is Irene, she is played by Carey Mulligan, and she lives with her young son down the hall from the driver. A neighborly flirtation is disrupted by the return from prison of Irenes husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), who gets pulled back into his old life of crime in such a way as to bring out the guns and require from the driver a few gruesomely violent acts of chivalry.    \n                                                       There is a bag full of money, a crosshatching of vendettas and betrayals, and an ambience of crepuscular Southern California anomie. There is also one scene of pure automotive pleasure, when the driver takes Irene and her son on a cruise along the kind of concrete culvert that has often been used for car chases in the past. But this is not The Big Lebowski, which took such delight in its status as pastiche that it ended up in a zone of wild originality and real feeling. Drive is somber, slick and earnest, and also a prisoner of its own emptiness, substituting moods for emotions and borrowed style for real audacity.    \n                                                       This is not to say that the movie is bad  as I have suggested, the skill and polish are hard to dispute  but rather that it is, for all its bravado, timid and conventional. In the hands of great filmmakers (like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Godard, to stick with relevant examples) genre can be a bridge between familiar narrative structures and new insights about how people interact and behave. Those are precisely what Drive is missing, in spite of some intriguingly nuanced performances.    \n                                                       The softness of Mr. Goslings face and his curiously high-pitched, nasal voice make him an unusually sweet-seeming avenger, even when he is stomping bad guys into bloody pulp. And Ms. Mulligans whispery diction and kewpie-doll features have a similarly disarming effect. Irene seems like much too nice a person to be mixed up in such nasty business. Not that shes really mixed up in it. Her innocence is axiomatic and part of the reason the driver goes to such messianic lengths to protect her.    \n                                                       To make the movie work on its own constricted terms, you need  beyond this girl and this guy, and the cars and the weapons  a colorful supporting cast. And this is what saves Drive from arch tedium: Mr. Cranstons wheezing, anxious loser; Christina Hendrickss seething, taciturn underworld professional; and above all Mr. Brookss diabolically nebbishy incarnation of corruption and venality.    \n                                                       In his self-authored comic roles, Mr. Brooks often exudes a passive-aggressive hostility, a latent capacity for violence held in check by neurosis and cowardice. He lets you assume the same in Drive until the moment he stabs someone in the eye with a fork. Its a shocking and oddly glorious moment  something a lot of us, without quite knowing it or being able to explain just why, have been waiting 30 years to see.    \n                                                       Drive is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

The rate at which this compact, masterful thriller ramps up in intensity is quick but stealthy. You\'re just starting to groove on its understated postmodern style when it shivs you between the ribs.\n \n              A minimalist car-chase movie, Drive somehow manages not to feel like a string of clichs torn from the earlier movies it references with a grave tenderness. Refn channels Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese, and Jean-Pierre Melville (while his captivating lead actor, Ryan Gosling, channels Marlon Brando, Clint Eastwood, and Steve McQueen). But what the two create together is something entirely distinct: an homage that\'s not a cheeky pastiche a la Tarantino, but a sincerely poetic gesture toward creating something like a neo-Neo-noir. The first line, "There are 100,000 streets in this city," might have come straight from a Paul Schrader script (the screenplay is by Hossein Amini). Though both highly stylized and highly stylish, Drive isn\'t hurting for substance. It has rich, complex characters (with one exception to be discussed below) and a storyline that\'s both emotionally engaging and almost sickeningly suspenseful.\n \n                    Never named in the film (in the credits, he\'s listed as "Driver"), Gosling\'s character is a solitary young man whose power derives from his very reserve. A Hollywood stunt driver by day, he also works part-time in the garage of an old friend, Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who soups cars up so Driver can use them to assist in small-time heists. Driver doesn\'t carry a gun, participate in the robbery or ask any questions: He just drives, and with great skill, as we learn in a slam-bang cold open. After picking up two hoods at their crime scene, he eludes the cops in a cat-and-mouse game so cleverly underplayed that it barely qualifies as a chase. (One of Driver\'s key moves is to douse the lights and pull into a parking space at the last possible second.)\n \n              Driver\'s boss Shannon is the smallest of small-time crooks, but he works for a pair of menacing Jewish gangsters, Bernie and Nino (Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman), who own a major piece of the city\'s crime business. Shannon wants to launch his talented protg as a race driver, and he convinces Bernie to invest in a fixer-upper stock car, to Nino\'s highly profane amusement. Meanwhile, Driver pursues a chaste flirtation with his apartment neighbor, a young mother named Irene (Carey Mulligan), whose husband (Oscar Isaac) is dangerously close to getting out of jail. \n \n              Just how the paths of Driver and his neighbors will intersect with those of Bernie, Nino, and their cohorts (including an unlucky moll played by Christina Hendricks) should be left for the movie to unfold, since the inexorably tightening crime plot is one of its chief pleasures. Suffice it to say that Driver has some surprises up the sleeve of his silver, scorpion-emblazoned jacket (which grows increasingly bloodstained as the film goes on). He\'s loyal to a fault, surprisingly gentle with Irene and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos), but prone to sudden acts of cold-blooded brutality. The movie\'s most difficult-to-watch scene is also its most virtuoso: Refn slows down time to make a four-floor elevator ride contain at least three movies\' worth of romance, suspense, and horror. \n \n              Driver underperforms only in the smallest of ways. Mulligan\'s character, while wonderfully played, could have been fleshed out better by the script: Driver is more complex than your average vigilante hero, but Irene is essentially a stock damsel in distress. And the \'80s-style, synth-fueled score by Cliff Martinez, while effective, felt too ubiquitousa little more silence would have been in keeping with the movie\'s mood of grim austerity.\n \n              Ryan Gosling\'s incarnation of the hauntingly lonely Driver is a beautifully realized, complete performance. He understands not just the psychology of the character, but how he fits into the tone and pacing of the film as a whole; he and Refn seem to be partnering as director and actor, the way Laura Dern partners with David Lynch or Julianne Moore with Todd Haynes. I\'ve read that Gosling first approached Refn, gave him the James Sallis novel this is based on and proposed turning it into a film. If true, this indicates two promising things about Gosling\'s future: He has both good taste and a keen sense of what projects he should take on as an actor. Here, this almost excessively beautiful performer is in complete control of his own considerable magnetism. In a role that could have flattered his vanity and allowed for all manner of ostentatious brooding, Gosling instead quietly dives into the emotional black hole at Driver\'s center, and takes us along for the ride.\n \n              Correction, Sept. 16, 2011: The article originally named The WeinsteinCo. as the production company for the film.
