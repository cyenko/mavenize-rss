But no matter how chilly and reserved, the mysteries at their core mesmerize rather than repel.\n As a getaway driver known only as Driver, Gosling obviously harks back to similar protagonists played by Ryan O\'Neal, Lee Marvin, Robert De Niro and especially Steve McQueen. \n But in "Drive," Gosling and director Nicolas Winding Refn neatly manage the hat trick of paying homage to those wheelmen of yore while reinvigorating the genre with style, smarts and flashes of wit. You may still want to fasten your seat belts, but in these capable, seductive hands you\'re in for a smooth, uncommonly assured ride.\n That\'s made clear in the opening sequence of "Drive," when Gosling\'s character fetches two thieves from a Los Angeles warehouse. Found out by the police, who begin to pursue them by way of patrol cars and a helicopter, Driver leads the fuzz not on the wheel-screeching, bombastic chase audience might expect, but on a quiet, cat-and-mouse prowl through Los Angeles\'s nighttime back streets, winding up in the endless proscenium arches of a parking garage. \n At once classic and refreshingly new, the sequence establishes Driver\'s watchful calm and psychic mettle, as well as Refn\'s indisputable chops as a filmmaker with firm command of tone, rhythm and irresistibly propulsive pacing.\n It turns out that Driver\'s getaway gig is just a sideline; his day job becomes clear in one of the all-time great movie "reveals," which makes "Drive" not just a fast-car action picture but a wry commentary on Hollywood artifice (which will come in handy later when someone covered in blood needs to blend in with a crowd). \n Carey Mulligan, as Driver\'s new neighbor Irene, may be completely miscast as the wife of a low-level criminal named Standard (the terrific Oscar Isaac), but her chemistry with Gosling is entirely believable, not least because Refn chooses to convey it through lyrical sequences of shy glances and wordlessly eloquent gestures.\n Far more persuasive, however improbably, is Albert Brooks as Bernie Rose, a seedy criminal middle-manager who like everyone in L.A. tried his hand in the biz, in his case as a producer. "One critic called them European," he wistfully recalls of his movies. Later, in one of the movie\'s most chilling scenes, he sweet-talks and soothes a hapless victim while he quietly slips a shiv in his arm, effecting a flawless balance between nebbishness and menace.\n Refn, a Danish director whose previous films include "Bronson" and "Valhalla Rising," is known for his love of blood, and when the plot of "Drive" quickens he finds plenty of chances to indulge in his penchant for lurid, stylized violence. But even his most fetishized flourishes are tempered here, not just with the tender love story between Irene and Driver but with Refn\'s newfound restraint (one pivotal murderous episode occurs entirely in shadow).\n After skillfully earning the audience\'s allegiance, "Drive," which is based on the novel by James Sallis, throws its hero\'s motives into more troubling ambiguity, with Gosling\'s grievous angel proving to be capable of startling brutality. Like the scorpion on his jacket, he can\'t escape his nature, and Refn does a good job of keeping that core moral essence opaque until the explosive end. He\'s also constructed a perfect showcase for Gosling\'s hangdog charisma, which has come into its own this year first with "Crazy, Stupid, Love" and next with "The Ides of March."\n A poster for the latter has his face morphing with George Clooney\'s, and the comparison is apt; indeed "Drive" recalls two of Clooney\'s best and recent movies, "Michael Clayton" and "The American." \n Like "Michael Clayton," "Drive" is a hushed, methodical ode to competence, a wistful wish-fulfillment fantasy in an age of mass screw-uppery. Like "The American," it\'s almost abstract in its willingness to eschew conventional plotting and dialogue for a subtle sound design and crisp, clean imagery.\n Most important, like Clooney\'s best movies, "Drive" features a compulsively watchable cipher at its center. Low-key, sleek and sophisticated, "Drive" provides the visceral pleasures of pulp without sacrificing art. It\'s cool and smart. Some critics might even call it European.\nContains strong brutal bloody violence and some nudity.'}, {'url': u'http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/man_on_transmission_4aYOolWcjHr2RBT0WP0ZIL?CMP=OTC-rss&FEEDNAME=', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Lou Lumenick', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-drive-20110916,0,5263663.story?track=rss', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Kenneth Turan', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/jI1eWDbdVoE/1', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Claudia Puig', 'text': "Unlike many films, which operate on a pre-set navigation system, this one's tautly cool story takes unexpectedly serpentine curves, much like the Los Angeles streets navigated by the masterful Ryan Gosling in the lead role.\n STORY: Interview with Ryan Gosling \nThe look is artfully stylized, influenced by classic film noir; the mood is dark; the performances nuanced; and the story unnervingly exciting.\nGosling, identified only as Driver, pilots cars for a living. Nothing else is revealed about him. In other films, this lack of back story could be a handicap. Here, it's no impediment; the present is so tense that audiences are caught up only in the pulse-quickening moment.\nDriver seems to have almost sprung into life as a coiled, confident and closed-off man. It's hard to imagine him having a childhood. So, his unexpected bond with Irene (Carey Mulligan), a sweet young mother who lives in his apartment building, and her sad-eyed little boy is all the more intriguing.\nThe film opens with Gosling calmly maneuvering a getaway car for a pair of thieves. He knows downtown L.A. so well that he outwits a platoon of squad cars and helicopters.\nDriver dabbles in criminal jobs by night, but during the daylight hours, he is an agile stunt driver and mechanic. He has a set of personal ethics that govern his association with the unsavory types he abets. His services are a limited-time offer. He'll assist their escape for only a number of minutes. After that, they're on their own.\nIn the hands of a lesser actor, Driver could have been an empty vessel. But Gosling pumps the minimalist character with brooding complexity. \nDanish-born director Nicolas Winding Refn's tight camera angles on Gosling's soulful eyes or clenched jaw serve to heighten the trance-like quality of the film. This art-house crime saga has a distinctly European sensibility. The film slows down to a deliberate pace, then revs on a dime to frantic speeds. Drenched in strikingly violent imagery, it may be off-putting for the squeamish.\nBreaking Bad's Bryan Cranston plays Driver's manager. Albert Brooks cleverly plays against type as a vicious mobster. \nDrive has an almost moralistic fairy-tale quality amid the graphic violence. Driver is both a protector of the innocent and a punisher of evildoers. A brutal beating in an elevator is an unforgettable scene for its juxtaposition with a tender kiss.\nThoroughly immersing, Drive leaves the competition in the dust.\n        For more information about reprints & permissions, visit our FAQ's.

His influences seem to change in every scene, from Michael Mann to John Woo to any moviemaker who ever directed Steve McQueen. Refn casts Christina Hendricks and somehow makes her look a little frumpy. After teasing the audience with two excellent car chases, our antihero barely breaks the speed limit in the second half of the film.\n And still, with its excess of carnage and stubborn lack of focus, the film is very satisfying. Mainstream audiences will probably be confounded by "Drive," while lovers of gritty filmmaking will defend every exaggerated shotgun wound as art. Know which camp you\'re in before you enter the theater. \n Refn has been making challenging independent cinema for years and is well regarded for his uncompromising work on films such as "Bronson" and the "Pusher" trilogy. He was reportedly hand-picked by actor Ryan Gosling for "Drive." Apparently, the red-hot Gosling thought his career would benefit from less talking and more smashing people with a hammer. \n Gosling is the nameless protagonist, who does Hollywood stunt work by day and moonlights as a getaway driver by night. He meets a beautiful neighbor (Carey Mulligan) with a desperate ex-con husband. He\'s introduced to a pair of low-level mob bosses (Ron Perlman, and the shockingly menacing Albert Brooks). For a few minutes, you\'ll swear the film is headed in the Tom Cruise/"Days of Thunder" stock-car film direction. Plans go awry, and the driver is on the run, using his skills, wits and a horror movie villain\'s relentless force to achieve his goals. \n A tense cat-and-mouse game with the police opens the film. A more muscular car chase shows up near the midway point. But just when you\'re sure this is the industry\'s best car-stunt film since "Ronin" in 1998, Refn changes focus again, and the mayhem rises to unexpected heights. The squeamish probably shouldn\'t go to "Drive" - or at least should acclimate themselves by watching "Eastern Promises" a few times.\n The complaints are minor and varied. Mulligan is beautiful but seems too fragile and passive for her role. Refn goes overkill on the long pauses - he would have had time for that epic third car chase if he eliminated half the slow motion in this film. \n The visuals are otherwise outstanding, featuring little-seen parts of Los Angeles, shot in wide angles with a steady hand. The music choices and Cliff Martinez score reimagines early 1980s pop music, minus the overproduction and sappy lyrics.\n Gosling continues his streak of excellent performances that are completely different from the previous one. Only an actor with incredible confidence would be willing to crib so much from Stallone\'s Marion Cobretti in the 1986 film "Cobra," and somehow make it work. Brooks may be even better, mostly because he has the element of surprise. He\'s a world away from his flop sweat in "Broadcast News" - stabbing people in the gut as if he\'s been doing it all his life.'}, {'url': u'http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2011/09/15/2011-09-15_drive_review_ryan_gosling_cruises_to_new_level_of_his_career.html', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Joe Neumaier', 'text': 'For all the movement in "Drive," the quiet, deathly still moments are the ones that count. A getaway driver\'s eyes watching minutes tick by. A scary businessman holding out his hand for a handshake. Two people meeting in a hallway, locking their doors without saying a word.\nAnd the most still thing of all is Ryan Gosling, whose coiled performance as a nameless Hollywood stunt driver cruising into trouble provides one of the most tense turns in this already hushful actor\'s young career.\nNot that there isn\'t tire squealing and hairpin maneuvers in "Drive," which contains a pair of scenes which show that this action-drama understands the elegant art of the car chase. There\'s also plenty of blood-letting, standoffs, shootouts and wordless mini-meditations on men and criminality. Yet it\'s the movie\'s threateningly low hum while it sits idling that really gets you.\nGosling\'s driver is never identified, though his garage mechanic employer Shannon (Bryan Cranston) calls him "kid." A man of fewer-than-few words, the kid is behind the wheel when a movie needs a spectacular crash. In his off hours, he\'s a wheelman for hire, zipping around and through shadowy Los Angeles streets, aiding and abetting robberies for a price.\nA normally careful guy, the driver is Shannon\'s way out of a dead-end life when a low-rent crime boss named Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) agrees to backing a stock car design Shannon has developed. But Rose and his thuggish partner (Ron Perlman) are unscrupulous and murderous, and, unknown to everyone, have a connection to the pretty neighbor (Carey Mulligan) who has cracked the driver\'s tough shell.\nDirected by the acceleratedly named Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, winner of the Best Director prize at Cannes, "Drive" is set in the present-day but has a quirky \'80s fixation in lighting, music and mood that could have stalled it. Refn\'s choice in neon lights and obscure synth-pop wind up putting "Drive" in the company of that era\'s "Thief" and "Manhunter," while other elements link it with "F/X" and even "American Gigolo." It\'s a risky move, but it pays off.\nAnd though Mulligan is miscast as a hard-luck mother awaiting her husband\'s parole, Gosling is eerily magnetic, and gets great support from Cranston, Perlman, Christina Hendricks (as a Tarantino-trashy burglary accessory) and, especially, Brooks. The comic-author-director does big-screen dramas about once a decade, and is clearly having fun here as a schlock producer-turned-barbarian with a thing for cutlery. Like everything else in "Drive," he can go from zero to 90 in a heartbeat.\nMagic Moment: In a life-or-death struggle, the driver and a villain\'s shadows merge, blending them into one knife-wielding image.'}, {'url': u'http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/20110915-drive-b.ece', 'rating': 3, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Chris Vognar', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/drive-cannes-2011-review-190649', 'rating': -1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Todd McCarthy', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903927204576572542212463116.html?mod=WSJ_ArtsEnt_LifestyleArtEnt_2', 'rating': -1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Joe Morgenstern', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2093404,00.html', 'rating': -1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'Jessica Winter', 'text': 'N/A'}, {'url': u'http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/movies/drive-with-ryan-gosling-review.html?smid=tw-nytimesmovies&seid=auto', 'rating': 1, 'date': u'2011-09-15', 'name': u'A.O.
