Down the hall is the apartment of Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). The Driver meets her and, against regulations, falls in love; at any rate, he cracks a smile, and twitches the toothpick that sits at the side of his mouth, so something must be stirring in his soul. The boys father, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in jail, and, when he comes out, the Driver, far from showing hostility, befriends him, and offers assistancea courtly, old-fashioned gesture, as though he lacked any better way of expressing his feelings for Irene. If Lancelot had lived next door to Guinevere, he would have done the same. Standard needs dough to pay off prison debts, which means taking part in a heist. The plan is that the Driver will chauffeur him to and from the job, without letting Irene hear about it. Needless to say, the plan backfires, and both men fall prey to some unsavory specimens, led by Bernie (Albert Brooks), with a glittering collection of knives, and Nino (Ron Perlman), who looks like something out of The Descent of Man.A surprisingly high fraction of Drive is indebted to The Driver, Walter Hills whittled-down thriller of 1978. The two films share that first pursuit, through a velvet-dark L.A.; the often wordless hero; a troublesome bag of cash; automobiles that dont simply whisk along but hide in corners, like cats; and the spare bursts of music, with Refn opting for an electronic underthrob, at the start, that nags like a migraine. Yet he also veers away from Hill in striking fashion, ditching any notion of a cop as a suitable nemesis (The Driver brought on Bruce Dern at his loopiest), and choosing, for a heroine, not the blank beauty of Isabelle Adjani, who appeared to be molded from porcelain, but the vulnerable sweetness of Carey Mulligan, whose smile would cause many road users to lose their grip and cannon into a lamppost. Last, nothing in Hills film is as entertaining as Bernies riff on his past career. In the nineteen-eighties, it appears, before launching into crime, he produced movies. One critic called them European, he recalls, adding, I thought they were shit. Credit to Refn, who is Danish, for running that gag.All this is excellent news, which makes it doubly wretched to report that, having delighted in the doominess of Drive, as its journey began, I ended much less joyful than repelled. What happened? In short, an explosionnot of a flaming car, or a bombed building, but of a head. (Whose head, I will not reveal, except to say that to damage such a performer, whether with a slap or, as here, with a shotgun, strikes me as a crime against nature.) Refn seems to have a thing about heads, and about the hurt that they can suffercapital punishment, in the worst sense. We watch as the Driver stamps, time and again, on the skull of a villain in an elevator; but what exactly are we watching, as the camera rests, for a second, on the mashed-up result? Prosthetics, pixellation, pastry dough? The people around me reacted with the eewrrgh sound that has become de rigueur in the viewing of violence, followed by the traditional hasty giggle to pop the tension; even those moviegoers who revel in such a sight, however, might usefully pause to inspect the kick of pleasure that it provokes. No doubt they will have seen much worse, and they will also know that a bursting brain is no more real than a game of Quidditch, yet what perturbs me about a film as careful and as intelligent as Drive is its manifest delusion that, in refusing to look away from the minutiae of nastiness, it is actually drawing us closer to the truth about pain.'}, {'url': u'http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/a-high-octane-drive/245180/', 'rating': 2, 'date': u'2011-09-16', 'name': u'Christopher Orr', 'text': "       Among its many resonances, Drive reminded me of Neil Jordan's Mona Lisa, another tale of a driver teetering between innocence and     cruelty; of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West, with their nameless, laconic protagonists and meticulous     buildups to spasms of sudden violence; of the original 1971 Get Carter and its intoxicating pitilessness; of Halloween in its use     ofwell, you'll see.

To this stage, Goslings blue-eyed stare, Mulligans conflicted sweetness, some splendidly creepy supporting work by Albert Brooks as the loquacious mob boss, and Refns noir-in-colour panache have all combined to keep the dirty business humming smartly along.  Oops, then comes the collision, when too much style gets vanquished by too little content. For example, Drivers inner beast is sporadically present but never accounted for. In the absence of any motivation or back-story, Gosling is left to play him with a simple on-off switch  nice guy one second, grape-stomper the next (the laugh-out-loud moment). Refn counters by doing what visually talented directors always do in substantively bankrupt circumstances  cranking up the style-meter even higher, fortifying the violence with lyrical slow-mo borrowed from Peckinpah, or shadowy knife-fights copped from Welles. The result? Just more uninvited chuckles.  Still, lets be generous here. Drive is noirishly attractive until it stalls, and inadvertently amusing after.

This is where Albert Brooks (as Bernie Rose) enters the fray, and hes never been better. Things arent too positive on the home front either as a shadowy figure from Mulligans past shows up at her door. Theres a child involved too, if only so we can see the melting of Goslings icy facade for a few moments.Gosling, for his part, seems to mature as an actor minute by minute as the film plays out. Driver is a dangerous sort of man, blustery cold with unpredictable moments of boil, and Gosling plays it all like a Stradivarius, which is to say he uses the very capable tool hes been given in a masterful manner.

Refn, who has a passionate cult following and some unlikely art-house cred for his deliriously violent Pusher trilogy and Bronson, is a child of the 1980s. For him, To Live and Die in L.A. and the collected works of Michael Mann are sacred texts to be restaged (more slo-mo! More blood! More crunching of bone!) and Goslingized. If '80s axiom Molly Ringwald had a custom font, it would be the jagged pink cursive of Drive's opening titles. Even the pop songs have the cocaine-cheesy sheen of a synth power ballad from the Miami Vice soundtrack. Minimalist Gosling has a heart, and it beats to a drum machine.  That heart is big and strong and selfless! But it can express itself only through wicked steering maneuvers, fisticuffs and placid TV-watching with Mulligan's son. And crime: to get her hubby out of a pinch, Gosling agrees to a pro bono heist that goes awry as expected, leaving him holding a bag full of Perlman's and Brooks' money. This is when the engines really start gunning and the heads really start exploding and the pearl-handled razors really start coming out. (By the way, if you want to see Christina Hendricks  Mad Men's Joan Holloway  in jeans and stilettos, here's your chance.) From the heist onward, Drive hits and maintains a steady rhythm of neon-lit paranoia punctuated by detonations of violence. The car chases are brisk and to the point. The murders are brisk and glutinous. (The most satisfying may be a twofer car crashdrowning that Gosling executes in a stuntman's cawl, when Drive for a moment becomes a lost entry in the Halloween franchise: Michael Myers Hits the Beach.) And the supporting players are B-movie bliss, leaving grit and grime on everything they touch. Surely there's a current crime serial (Boardwalk Empire? Cranston's Breaking Bad?) that could create a villain role for Brooks, who plays his psychopath as an irritable pragmatist with a curatorial eye for sharp objects. See Halloween in TIME's top 10 movie franchises.  Minimalist Gosling makes for a magnetic cyborg, and Minimalist Mulligan tries to match him: whether Gosling is just gazing at her (which he does a lot) or divesting a baddie's face from his jaw in an elevator (which he does only once), she arranges her face into a picture of sad-eyed amusement, with occasional variations of amused sadness. Their romance follows a chronology not of banter, flirtation and foreplay but stares and blinks. Refn's mix of grind-house horror with sweetie-pie sentiment is a recipe mastered by Takeshi Kitano (and, in his own way, David Lynch), but this director's brew is simpler, more direct, less cerebral and less heartfelt. To invest oneself emotionally in the central relationship, or the movie itself, would be akin to investing oneself emotionally in one's car. But when the car looks this good and drives this fast, why not?

He understands not just the psychology of the character, but how he fits into the tone and pacing of the film as a whole; he and Refn seem to be partnering as director and actor, the way Laura Dern partners with David Lynch or Julianne Moore with Todd Haynes. I've read that Gosling first approached Refn, gave him the James Sallis novel this is based on and proposed turning it into a film. If true, this indicates two promising things about Gosling's future: He has both good taste and a keen sense of what projects he should take on as an actor. Here, this almost excessively beautiful performer is in complete control of his own considerable magnetism. In a role that could have flattered his vanity and allowed for all manner of ostentatious brooding, Gosling instead quietly dives into the emotional black hole at Driver's center, and takes us along for the ride.
